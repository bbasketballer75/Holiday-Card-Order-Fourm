# Workspace AI Memory
This file contains workspace-specific information for AI conversations.

## Memories
- **2025-11-16 13:35:** Default shell set to PowerShell for this repo, prefer `Set-Location`/`Push-Location`, use Node CLI over `npm`/`npx` in PowerShell. Use `npm run setup-powershell` and `npm run setup-dev` to ensure environment is ready, install GH & Supabase CLIs, and Playwright browsers.
- **2025-11-16 14:25:** Vercel deployment replaced with Railway.app (Nov 16, 2025) - completely removed Vercel from project due to rate-limit issues (hitting 100+ deployments/day limit). Railway.app offers free tier with $5/month credits, no deployment rate limits, simple GitHub integration, auto-deploy on push. Updated README.md, DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md, SECURITY-ROTATE-SECRETS.md, and project memory files. Committed and pushed to chore/prettier-overrides branch (commit 40219bb).
