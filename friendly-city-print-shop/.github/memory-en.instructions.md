- **2025-11-15 19:33:** Project: Friendly City Print Shop (workspace: Holiday Card Order Fourm) - An interactive online forum and ordering system for holiday cards. Tech stack preference: Next.js 14 (app router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. Backend: Supabase (auth, database, storage) + Stripe for payments (test mode). Hosting: Railway.app for free tier, optional local dev with Node 18. Preferences: Keep costs free/low, use .env.local for secrets, never use dummy API keys in repo, automate setup where possible. Testing notes: Playwright baseURL should respect PORT env var; FAST_TEST mode must load env vars before starting dev server. Developer OS: Windows. This workspace memory should be used for project-specific scaffolding, CI settings, and deployment instructions.
